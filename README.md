Ruby Command Line Docopt Template
=================================

A template for easily creating command line utilities in Ruby using

command.

Usage:
------

- Copy or clone the repository
- Run `bundle install` to install docopt, if not already installed
- Edit the `docopt.txt` file to match your program
- Rename `program.rb` to your program's name
- Edit `commands.rb` and add a function for each command
